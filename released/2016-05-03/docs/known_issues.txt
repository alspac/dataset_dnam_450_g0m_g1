  Issues:
    - Confounding between Slide and sample type in cord blood samples.
    - Large sample type effects (bloodspots vs white cells) in cord blood.
    - Issues with age for mums TF1-3. For some mums it is unknown whether they are sampled at TF1, 2 or 3. 
    - Slide effects are still there even after regressing out Slide before normalisation. 
    - Variance components modelling shows that a lot of residual variance is still present after normalisation and regressing out age, gender, cellcounts, sampletype, aln, aln_qlet, aln_qlet_timepoint and slide.
