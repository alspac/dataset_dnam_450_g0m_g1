    description: >-
      The 850 control probes are summarized in 42 control types.
      These probes can roughly be divided into negative control probes
        (613), probes intended for between array normalization (186)
        and the remainder (49), which are designed for quality
        control, including assessing the
        bisulfite conversion rate. None of these probes are designed
        to measure a biological signal.
        The summarized control probes can be used as surrogates for
        unwanted variation and are used for the functional
        normalization.
        Samples are rows and 42 control types are in columns.

      This objects contain samples extracted from LIMS and is not
      cleaned up. This object has been used to do the data cleaning.
      All data processing has been conducted using Meffil.
      Meffil uses illuminaio R package to parse Illumina IDAT files
      into a meffil object called qc.objects. All meffil functions,
      QC summary, functional normalization and post-normalization QC summary
      operate on the qc or norm.objects. Specifically, the qc.objects contain
      raw control probe intensities, poor quality probes based on
      detection Pvalues and number of beads, predicted sex,  predicted
      cellcounts and a samplesheet with batch variables.
      In addition, copy number variation can be extracted. This object is a list of individuals.
