DATASET: ALSPAC_ARIES_Methylation

17-December-2015
	
	DESCRIPTION
		A subset of 1018 mother and their offspring pairs from ALSPAC dataset is in the ARIES. Their selection criteria was availability of DNA samples for 2 time points of mothers antenatal and follow-up when the offspring mean age was 17.1 years and 3 time points for the offspring neonatal, childhood (mean age 7.5) and adolescence mean age 17.1 years.

	Laboratory
		ALSPAC laboratory, Oakfield House, University of Bristol
	
	Laboratory acquisition of DNA methylation data
		Bisulfite Conversion
			Zymo EZ DNA MethylationTM kit (Zymo, Irvine, CA)
		Measurement of genome-wide methylation
			Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip
		Beta value
			For each sample the proportion of DNA molecules methylated at each CpG site

	QC of data
		LIMS
			Batch variables
				Sample batch, BeadArray, reagent batches, sample plates, lab equipment, personnel, date/time of each step 
			QC metrics from the standard control probes on the 450k BeadChip
		Samples failing quality control
			Samples with >20% probes with p-value >= 0.01
		Additional QC step
			Compared genotype probes on the HM450k between samples from the same individual and against SNP-chip data to identify and remove any sample mismatches
			Flagged where there is a sex-mismatch (based on X-chr methylation)

	Filters
		List of non-specific probes, snp-confounded probes etc from "Chen YA, et al. Discovery of cross-reactive probes and polymorphic CpGs in the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 microarray. Epigenetics. 2013 Jan 11;8(2)"
		List of CpG probes which provided accurate or noisy signals from "Naeem H, et al. Reducing the risk of false discovery enabling identification of biologically significant genome-wide methylation status using the HumanMethylation450 array. BMC Genomics. 2014 Jan 22;15(1):51."

	Batch effects
		BCD plate (bisulphite conversion batch) is the major batch variable

	Numbers in each time point pre and post QC
		Pre-QC 
			?
		Post-QC
			cord: 914, F7: 973,15up: 974,antenatal: 951 and FOM: 970
			
	Normalisation of data
		Normalised in R with the wateRmelon package ["Schalkwyk LC, et al. Illumina 450 methylation array normalization and metrics. 2013"]  using the "Tost" algorithm to reduce the non-biological differences between probes 

	Tissue composition
		Houseman estimateCellCounts function of minfi. Takes blood and return the relative proportions of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, natural killer cells, monocytes, granulocytes, and b-cells in each sample.
